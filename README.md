Absolutely! Here's a clean, professional **README.md** you can use for your **HandSpeak** project.  
I'll include **installation instructions**, **libraries needed**, **how to run**, and a little **project description** too.

# HandSpeak ✋🗣️

HandSpeak is a hand gesture recognition system that allows users to form sentences or perform calculations using hand signs.  
It uses **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and a **TensorFlow-trained neural network**, all wrapped in a **Streamlit** web app interface.

## Features

- 📖 **Text Mode:** Select letters via hand signs to form sentences.
- ➗ **Calculator Mode:** Perform mathematical operations through gesture-based number and operator input.
- 🖐️ Real-time hand tracking using **MediaPipe**.
- 🔤 Predictive text construction with gesture-based editing (Space, Delete, etc.).

## Installation

First, make sure you have **Python 3.8 or higher** installed.

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handspeak.git
cd handspeak
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
```

3. **Install the required libraries**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## How to Run the Project

Once everything is installed:
1. run collect_data.py to collect gestures
2. run rotate.py to rotate and flip the data
3. run train.py to create and train cnn model
4. 
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- `app.py` is the main file that launches the Streamlit application.
- Make sure your **webcam** is connected and accessible!
- In the app, you can **choose between "Text Mode" and "Calculator Mode"**.
- Perform gestures in front of the webcam to interact.

## Libraries Used

| Library     | Purpose                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| OpenCV      | Capturing webcam input and image processing |
| MediaPipe   | Real-time hand landmark detection         |
| TensorFlow  | Neural network model for gesture recognition |
| Streamlit   | Web app interface                         |
| NumPy       | Array and numerical operations            |

## Notes

- **Lighting** matters! Good lighting improves hand tracking accuracy.
- Make sure **no other apps** are using the webcam.
- If needed, retrain the model with your own gestures for better customization.

## Future Improvements

- 🧠 Add more gestures (e.g., punctuation marks).
- 📱 Mobile compatibility.
- 🛡️ Enhance error handling and gesture misclassification correction.
